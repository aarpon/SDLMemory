[SDLMemory](http://www.scs2.net/next/index.php?id=200) is a very simple memory game written in C++ with the [Simple Directmedia Library](http://libsdl.org/). It's a very old project, but it's still around since it was added to quite a few open-source collections and was even ported to AmigaOS4 for the PowerPC architecture by Curtis Holborn for the Aminet network (the original project page [no longer exists](http://us2.aminet.net/game/think/sdlmemory.readme), but [the LHA archive can still be downloaded](http://us2.aminet.net/game/think/sdlmemory.lha)).  Starting end 2009 it was hosted for a few years on softpedia.com (that [link](http://games.softpedia.com/get/Freeware-Games/SDLMemory.shtml) is also broken).
